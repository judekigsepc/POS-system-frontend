# Project Update: Transition to a Full-Fledged Business Management System (BMS)

## Reason for Discontinuation
I am upgrading this project to a **full-fledged Business Management System (BMS)**, which requires drastic changes to the codebase and project structure. Due to the scope of these changes and my decision to refactor the project into **TypeScript**, I have opted not to use this same repository.

## Current Status
Everything in this repository works and is bug-free, except for the following features that are yet to be implemented:
- **Analytics**
- **Reporting**

## Features That Work
1. **POS Operations**:
   - All cart operations
   - Payment processing
   - Discounting
   - Transactions
   - Invoice generation, printing, and emailing
   - All features implemented in real-time using **Socket.IO**, providing a great user experience.

2. **Role-Based Authentication**:
   - Fine-grained access control based on user roles.

3. **Stock Management**:
   - Comprehensive inventory management capabilities.

4. **Collections**:
   - Support for advanced sales features.

5. **Configuration**:
   - Extensive customization options (too many to list here).

6. **Business Registration**:
   - Seamless registration and setup for businesses.

## Future Plans
I am **not ditching the POS** project. Instead, I will:
- Continue working on it after refactoring and restructuring the project to include all features of a **POS** and **BMS**.
- Transition to **TypeScript** for improved code quality and maintainability.

This repository will remain archived as a reference for the completed features.
